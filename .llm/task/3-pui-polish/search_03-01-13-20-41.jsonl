Tu dois également router l'information concernant le décalage de deadline du module \"Risk\" reçu dans ton inbox. Enfin, n'oublie pas d'envoyer la facture de février à Lumio Studio pour tes revenus récurrents.\n\nVoici le détail des fichiers pertinents pour guider ta journée :\n```tasks.md\n1   | ---\n2   | created: 2026-03-01 00:23:00.419203\n3   | updated: 2026-03-01 00:23:00.434096\n4   | tokens: 216\n5   | ---\n6   | # Global Tasks\n7   | \n8   | - [ ] Fix Linear webhook signature validation #saas-app (Due: 2025-03-03)\n9   | - [ ] Send February invoice to Lumio Studio #freelance-agency\n10  | - [ ] Push David for the production-like staging API keys #freelance-fintech (BLOCKED)\n11  | - [x] Review Sarah's feedback on Pulseboard landing page #saas-app\n12  | - [ ] Finish Rust 'Lifetimes' chapter #personal #learning\n13  | - [x] Fix typo in Forma README.md #oss-toolkit\n14  | - [ ] Propose $150/hr rate for the React Portal project #freelance-agency\n15  | - [ ] Investigate performance regression in Forma v2.3.0 #oss-toolkit\n16  | - [ ] Buy new office chair (Herman Miller?) #personal\n17  | - [ ] Set up backup cron job for Pulseboard DB #saas-app\n18  | - [x] Weekly grocery run #personal\n19  | - [ ] Draft 'predictive analysis' feasibility doc for Marcus #freelance-fintech\n```\n\n```projects/saas-app/roadmap.md\n1   | ---\n2   | created: 2026-03-01 00:21:55.951852\n3   | updated: 2026-03-01 00:21:55.970719\n4   | tokens: 183\n5   | ---\n6   | # Roadmap - Pulseboard\n7   | \n8   | ## Current Cycle (v0.5)\n9   | - [ ] Fix Linear webhook validation (High, 3 days)\n10  | - [ ] Implement multi-workspace support for GitHub (Medium, 5 days)\n11  | - [ ] Add CSV export for metric history (Low, 2 days)\n12  | \n13  | ## Parked / Icebox\n14  | - **Slack Integration:** Everyone asks for it, but I want to nail the core dashboard first.\n15  | - **Mobile App:** Web dashboard is responsive enough for now.

It mentions a \"deadline push\" (potential blocker) and a \"risk module\" (which is part of the project's core deliverables).\n13  | \n14  | The agent is unsure where to route this:\n15  | 1. **`projects/freelance-fintech/blockers.md`**: The deadline push is a clear blocker for the next phase.\n16  | 2. **`projects/freelance-fintech/decisions.md`**: If the deadline push forces a change in *how* we build the module, it's a decision.\n17  | 3. **New File `projects/freelance-fintech/deadlines.md`**: Should we start tracking deadlines separately?\n18  | \n19  | ## Current Status\n20  | **Waiting for User Response.**\n21  | Alex, how should I handle this? Should I update the blockers file, or create a new dedicated deadlines log for the fintech project?\n```"}
